# ColorGame_JavaScript
This is basic color game which can improve your color guessing according to the RGB values. 
Initially, game displays one random rgb value in rgb(redValue,greenValue,blueValue) fromat,the each color value would be between 0 and 255.
On the same page itself, the game diaplays six random colors.
Here, challenge is guess the right color in those six colos that would match the displayed rgb value right above. 
You can pic the colors until you select the right color
You can switch to easy mode, that displays three colors, if you find any dificulties with Hard mode.
The project inculdes three files,one html,css, and java script file.
All the styling things taken care by CSS file
The javascript file is simply written using vanilla javascript.
I hope you enjoy the game.
